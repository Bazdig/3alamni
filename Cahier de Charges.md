# 3alamni
3alamni is a website for learning and sharing knowledge along the tunisian population.

# Problem
We live too separated, where each person has to learn a bunch of skills outside of his specialty just to see if his idea is good or not. As such, countless hours are lost in total trying to master multiple domains and ending up still being a generalist.
This causes so many prototypes, ideas and projects to never be done.

# Solution
If instead of each person spending 100 hours on 5 subjects, each could spend 80 hours in a specialty, learning, experimenting, and writing a conclusive note for others to read, and spend the 20 remaining hours reading conclusive notes let by others.
This would not only make us lose less time, they would make us more productive and clear-minded, as we know the work has been done by a specialist who knows far more than us.

# Technical Part
For starters, this app only has client-end, where users choose a domain and course name, and find in it a summary of that topic as well as additional resources like source videos, articles etc..

The back end shall be handled by an admin for now.


# Busines Plan
for members, it's free, for others, premium courses & coaching.
for business, the data can be bought.

# Value Proposition
Everything is in tunisian, for any category of people to read.
